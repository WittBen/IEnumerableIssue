# IEnumerableIssue

This repository explores performance issues related to the misuse of `IEnumerable` in C#. It demonstrates how improper handling of deferred execution can negatively impact performance, particularly in scenarios involving multiple enumerations of the same collection. The project provides examples to illustrate how developers can avoid these pitfalls and optimize their use of `IEnumerable` for better performance in real-world applications.
